	2. ```mv ~/SinusBot-Stream/SinusBot-Stream/ /var/www/html```

	B) Method b: Clone this repository to a direcotry and create a symlink. This will make it easier to pull updates. (Note that [FollowSymLinks](http://superuser.com/questions/244245/how-do-i-get-apache-to-follow-symlinks) must be set in your apache site settings).
    
	1. ```cd /var/www/ && git clone https://github.com/Zahzi/SinusBot-Stream.git```

	2. ```cd /var/www/html && ln -s /var/www/SinusBot-Stream/SinusBot-Stream/```

   1.  ```nano /opt/sinusbot/config.ini```
   
   2. Set ```EnableWebStream = true``` and ```SampleInterval = 60```
    
    3. Save the file.

5. Edit SinusBot-Stream's config.php:
	1. ```nano /var/www/html/SinusBot-Stream/config.php```
     
    2. Make sure the follow settings are set:
		* Set ```$ip``` to the ip of the server that SinusBot is running on. This is the same ip you use to access the admin panel. (can be a DNS name).

		* Set ```$port``` to be the port the SinusBot is set to run on.

		* Set ```$enableSSL = true``` if SinusBot is set to run on https

		* Set ```$user``` to be the username for the stream to login to in
SinusBot. This user needs login permission. It's recommended not to give it anything else.

		* Set ```$password``` to be the corresponding password to the user.

		* Set ```$instanceIDS``` to be an array containing all instances that you wish to use in quotes separated by commas. Eg: ```$instanceIDS = array("10d82776-f87c-41ee-be62-bb17738538c3", "09a54439-g77a-41dd-fd25-bc14422548d3");``` Get the instance IDs from "Instance Settings": !["Where to get instance ID"](https://www.zahzi.us/screenshots/1486179273.png)
	
		* Set ```$instanceNames``` to be an array of names you wish to display corresponding to the instances. You must have the same number of names as instances in quotes separated by commas. Example: ```$instanceNames = array("MusicBot #1", "MusicBot #2");```

	3. Save the file.

6. Access the stream at http(s)://yourip/SinusBot-Stream/. If you wish to configure the stream to run on a different port, update the apache settings.
